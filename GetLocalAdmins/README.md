# How to use

You can edit which OUs you want to hit in the AdminCheck.ps1 file.

For those who don't know, WinRM is needed to execute powershell commands remotely. There is no need for workstations to have this service enabled and it will be turned off at the end of the script.


Make sure you have the privileges to run this script.
Run AdminCheck.ps1 with everything in the same directory. Enjoy your CSV.
