# How to use

You can edit which OUs you want to hit in the AdminCheck.ps1 file.
This script will turn off WinRM on all machines once finished. Please make sure you are not hitting anything where you need WinRM to be enabled.
Make sure you have the privileges to run this script.
This will only work in an AD environment on windows machines. It is meant for workstations, do not run on servers without considering whether winRM should be enabled.
Run AdminCheck.ps1 with everything in the same directory. Enjoy your CSV.
